# Logistics_Performance_and_Delivery_Optimization_Strategy
This Power BI project analyzes shipment data from a logistics company to uncover the root causes of delivery delays and customer dissatisfaction. Using a dataset of 10,999 records, I explored how factors like shipment mode, warehouse location, product importance, weight, cost, and customer behavior affect delivery performance. The dashboard includes 12 insightful visuals built with Power BI and DAX to help decision-makers pinpoint operational inefficiencies and improve logistics strategies. This project helped me apply data storytelling, visualization, and business analysis skills in a practical, real-world context.
